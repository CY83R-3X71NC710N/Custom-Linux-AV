# Ideology
With GNU/Linux realtime protection and windows malware scanning tools like clamAV will not be as important but still very important, however, rootkits are really the issue and this custom linux antivirus has a focus on rootkits rather than general malware scanners. I will also in the future maybe develop a GNU/Linux hardening script. This script places malware in a quarantine folder so you decide what to do with the detections.
